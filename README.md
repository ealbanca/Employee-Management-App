# Overview

This is an employee management web application built with Flask and MySQL for managing employee records. The app allows users to:

- Add new employees with details such as name, email, phone, employee ID, department, start date, and hourly salary.
- Search for employees by name, email, phone, employee ID, or department.
- View a list of employees in a table format.
- Edit employee details by clicking the "Edit" button next to an employeeâ€™s record.
- Delete employees by clicking the "Delete" button, with a confirmation prompt.
All employee data is stored in a MySQL database. The app uses HTML templates for the user interface and supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee management.
Since this uses a local database, please Run these commands to create the local database and table in MySQL (Don't forget to update the db configuration user and password on the app.py file with your local credentials) :

CREATE DATABASE employee_db;
USE employee_db;
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    employee_id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);
