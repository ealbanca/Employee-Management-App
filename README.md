# Overview

This is an employee management web application built with Flask and MySQL for managing employee records. The app allows users to:

- Add new employees with details such as name, email, phone, employee ID, department, start date, and hourly salary.
- Search for employees by name, email, phone, employee ID, or department.
- View a list of employees in a table format.
- Edit employee details by clicking the "Edit" button next to an employeeâ€™s record.
- Delete employees by clicking the "Delete" button, with a confirmation prompt.
All employee data is stored in a MySQL database. The app uses HTML templates for the user interface and supports basic features like Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for employee management.
Since this uses a local database, please Run the createTable.py file (Don't forget to update the database configuration user and password on the cretaeTable.py and app.py file with your local credentials).
